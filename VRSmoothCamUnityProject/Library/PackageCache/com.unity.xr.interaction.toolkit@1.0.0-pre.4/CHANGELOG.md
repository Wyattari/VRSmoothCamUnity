## [1.0.0-pre.4] - 2021-05-14

### Added
- Added Tracked Device Physics Raycaster component to enable physics-based UI interaction through Unity's Event System. This is similar to Physics Raycaster from the Unity UI package, but with support for raycasts from XR Controllers.
- Added `finalizeRaycastResults` event to `UIInputModule` that allows a callback to modify raycast results before they are used by the event system.
- Added column to XR Interaction Debugger to show an Interactor's valid targets from `XRBaseInteractor.GetValidTargets`.
- Added property to XR Controller to allow the model to be set to a child object instead of forcing it to be instantiated from prefab.

### Changed
- Changed Grab Interactable to have a consistent attach point between all Movement Type values, fixing it not attaching at the Attach Transform when using Instantaneous when the object's Transform position was different from the Rigidbody's center of mass. To use the old method of determining the attach point in order to avoid needing to modify the Attach Transform for existing projects, set Attach Point Compatibility Mode to Legacy. Legacy mode will be removed in a future version. ([1294410](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/1294410))
- Changed Grab Interactable to also set the Rigidbody to kinematic upon being grabbed when the Movement Type is Instantaneous, not just when Kinematic. This improves how it collides with other Rigidbody objects.
- Changed Grab Interactable to allow its Attach Transform to be updated while grabbed instead of only using its pose at the moment of being grabbed. This requires not using Legacy mode.
- Changed Grab Interactable to no longer use the scale of the selecting Interactor's Attach Transform. This often caused unintended offsets when grabbing objects. The position of the Attach Transform should be used for this purpose rather than the scale. Projects that depended on that functionality can use Legacy mode to revert to the old method.
- Changed Grab Interactable default Movement Type from Kinematic to Instantaneous.
- Changed Grab Interactable default values for damping and scale so Velocity Tracking moves more similar to the other Movement Type values, making the distinguishing feature instead be how it collides with other Colliders without Rigidbodies. Changed `velocityDamping` from 0.4 to 1, `angularVelocityDamping` from 0.4 to 1, and `angularVelocityScale` from 0.95 to 1.
- Changed Socket Interactor override of the Movement Type of Interactables from Kinematic to Instantaneous.
- Changed XR Controller so it does not modify the Transform position, rotation, or scale of the instantiated model prefab upon startup instead of resetting those values.
- Changed Controller Interactors to let the XR Controller be on a parent GameObject.
- Changed so XR Interaction Debugger's Input Devices view is off by default.
- Changed Tracked Device Graphic Raycaster to fallback to using `Camera.main` when the Canvas does not have an Event Camera set.
- Changed XR Rig property for the Tracking Origin Mode to only contain supported modes. A value of Not Specified will use the default mode of the XR device.
- Changed **GameObject &gt; XR** menu to only have a single XR Rig rather than separate menu items for Room-Scale and Stationary. Change the Tracking Origin Mode property on the created XR Rig to Floor or Device, respectively, for the same behavior as before.

### Deprecated
- Deprecated `XRBaseController.modelTransform` due to being renamed to `XRBaseController.modelParent`.
- Deprecated `XRRig.trackingOriginMode` due to being replaced with an enum type that only contains supported modes. Use `XRRig.requestedTrackingOriginMode` and `XRRig.currentTrackingOriginMode` instead.

### Fixed
- Fixed Interaction Manager throwing exception `InvalidOperationException: Collection was modified; enumeration operation may not execute.` when an Interactor or Interactable was registered or unregistered during processing and events.
- Fixed Windows Mixed Reality controllers having an incorrect pose when using the Default Input Actions sample. The Position and Rotation input actions will try to bind to `pointerPosition` and `pointerRotation`, and fallback to `devicePosition` and `deviceRotation`. If the sample has already been imported into your project, you will need to import again to get the update.
- Fixed Input System actions such as Select not being recognized as pressed in `ActionBasedController` when it was bound to an Axis control (for example '<XRController>/grip') rather than a Button control (for example '<XRController>/gripPressed').
- Fixed XR Interaction Debugger to display Interactors and Interactables from multiple Interaction Managers.
- Fixed XR Interaction Debugger having overlapping text when an Interactor was hovering over multiple Interactables.
- Fixed Tree View panels in the XR Interaction Debugger to be collapsable.
- Fixed `TestFixture` classes in the test assembly to be `internal` instead of `public`.
- Fixed Grab Interactable to use scaled time for easing and smoothing instead of unscaled time.
- Fixed Direct and Socket Interactor not being able to interact with an Interactable with multiple Colliders when any of the Colliders leaves the trigger instead of only when all of them leave. ([1325375](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/1325375))
- Fixed Direct and Socket Interactor not being able to interact with an Interactable when either were registered after the trigger collision occurred.
- Fixed `XRSocketInteractor` to include the select target in its list of valid targets returned by `GetValidTargets`.
- Fixed `XRBaseController` so it applies the controller state during Before Render even when Input Tracking is disabled.
- Fixed missing namespace of `InputHelpers` to be `UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit`.

## [1.0.0-pre.3] - 2021-03-18

### Added
- Added ability for serialized fields added in derived behaviors to automatically appear in the Inspector. Users will no longer need to create a custom [Editor](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Editor.html) to be able to see those fields in the Inspector. See [Extending the XR Interaction Toolkit](../manual/index.html#extending-the-xr-interaction-toolkit) in the manual for details about customizing how they are drawn.
- Added support for `EnhancedTouch` from the Input System for AR gesture classes. This means AR interaction is functional when the Active Input Handling project setting is set to Input System Package (New).
- Added registration events to `XRBaseInteractable` and `XRBaseInteractor` which work like those in `XRInteractionManager` but for just that object.
- Added new methods in `ARPlacementInteractable` to divide the logic in `OnEndManipulation` into `TryGetPlacementPose`, `PlaceObject`, and `OnObjectPlaced`.
- Added `XRRayInteractor.hitClosestOnly` property to limit the number of valid targets. Enable this to make only the closest Interactable receive hover events rather than all Interactables in the full length of the raycast.
- Added new methods in `XRRayInteractor` for getting information about UI hits, and made more methods `virtual` or `public`.
- Added several properties to Grab Interactable (Damping and Scale) to allow for tweaking the velocity and angular velocity when the Movement Type is Velocity Tracking. These values can be adjusted to reduce oscillation and latency from the Interactor.

### Changed
- Changed script execution order so `LocomotionProvider` occurs before Interactors are processed, fixing Ray Interactor from casting with stale controller poses when moving or turning the rig and causing visual flicker of the line.
- Changed script execution order so `XRUIInputModule` processing occurs after `LocomotionProvider` and before Interactors are processed to fix the frame delay with UI hits due to using stale raycast rays. `XRUIInputModule.Process` now does nothing, override `XRUIInputModule.DoProcess` which is called directly from `Update`.
- Changed `XRUIInputModule.DoProcess` from `abstract` to `virtual`. Overriding methods in derived classes should call `base.DoProcess` to ensure `IUpdateSelectedHandler` event sending occurs as before.
- Changed Ray Interactor's Reference Frame property to use global up as a fallback when not set instead of the Interactor's up.
- Changed Ray Interactor Projectile Curve to end at ground height rather than controller height. Additional Ground Height and Additional Flight Time properties can be adjusted to control how long the curve travels, but this change means the curve will be longer than it was in previous versions.
- Changed `TrackedDeviceGraphicRaycaster` to ignore Trigger Colliders by default when checking for 3D occlusion. Added `raycastTriggerInteraction` property to control this.
- Changed `XRBaseInteractor.allowHover` and `XRBaseInteractor.allowSelect` to retain their value instead of getting changed to `true` during `OnEnable`. Their initial values are unchanged, remaining `true`.
- Changed some AR behaviors to be more configurable rather than using some hardcoded values or requiring using MainCamera. AR Placement Interactable and AR Translation Interactable must now specify a Fallback Layer Mask to support non-trackables instead of always using Layer 9.
- Changed `IUIInteractor` to not inherit from `ILineRenderable`.

### Deprecated
- Deprecated `XRBaseInteractor.enableInteractions`, use `XRBaseInteractor.allowHover` and `XRBaseInteractor.allowSelect` instead.

### Removed
- Removed several MonoBehaviour message functions in AR behaviors to use `ProcessInteractable` and `ProcessInteractor` instead.

### Fixed
- Fixed issue where the end of a Projectile or Bezier Curve lags behind and appears bent when the controller is moved too fast. ([1291060](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/1291060))
- Fixed Ray Interactor interacting with Interactables that are behind UI. ([1312217](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/1312217))
- Fixed `XRRayInteractor.hoverToSelect` not being functional. ([1301630](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/1301630))
- Fixed Ray Interactor not allowing for valid targets behind an Interactable with multiple Collider objects when the ray hits more than one of those Colliders.
- Fixed Ray Interactor performance to only perform raycasts once per frame instead of each time `GetValidTargets` is called by doing it during `ProcessInteractor` instead.
- Fixed exception in `XRInteractorLineVisual` when changing the Sample Frequency or Line Type of a Ray Interactor.
- Fixed Ray Interactor anchor control rotation when the Rig plane was not up. Added a property `anchorRotateReferenceFrame` to control the rotation axis.
- Fixed Reference Frame missing from the Ray Interactor Inspector when the Line Type was Bezier Curve.
- Fixed mouse scroll amount being too large in `XRUIInputModule` when using Input System.
- Fixed Scrollbar initially scrolling to incorrect position at XR pointer down when using `TrackedDeviceGraphicRaycaster`, which was caused by `RaycastResult.screenPosition` never being set.
- Fixed `GestureRecognizer` skipping updating some gestures during the same frame when another gesture finished.
- Fixed namespace of several Editor classes to be in `UnityEditor.XR.Interaction.Toolkit` instead of `UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit`.
- Fixed default value of Blocking Mask on Tracked Device Graphic Raycaster to be Everything (was skipping Layer 31).

## [1.0.0-pre.2] - 2021-01-20

### Added
- Added registration events to `XRInteractionManager` and `OnRegistered`/`OnUnregistered` methods to `XRBaseInteractable` and `XRBaseInteractor`.
- Added and improved XML documentation comments and tooltips.
- Added warnings to XR Controller (Action-based) when referenced Input Actions have not been enabled.
- Added warning to Tracked Device Graphic Raycaster when the Event Camera is not set on the World Space Canvas.

### Changed
- Changed `XRBaseInteractable` and `XRBaseInteractor` to no longer register with `XRInteractionManager` in `Awake` and instead register and unregister in `OnEnable` and `OnDisable`, respectively.
- Changed the signature of all interaction event methods (e.g. `OnSelectEntering`) to take event data through a class argument rather than being passed the `XRBaseInteractable` or `XRBaseInteractor` directly. This was done to allow for additional related data to be provided by the Interaction Manager without requiring users to handle additional methods. This also makes it easier to handle the case when the selection or hover is canceled (due to either the Interactor or Interactable being unregistered as a result of being disabled or destroyed) without needing to duplicate code in an `OnSelectCanceling` and `OnSelectCanceled`.
  |Old Signature|New Signature|
  |---|---|
  |`OnHoverEnter*(XRBaseInteractor interactor)`<br/>-and-<br/>`OnHoverEnter*(XRBaseInteractable interactable)`|`OnHoverEnter*(HoverEnterEventArgs args)`|
  |`OnHoverExit*(XRBaseInteractor interactor)`<br/>-and-<br/>`OnHoverExit*(XRBaseInteractable interactable)`|`OnHoverExit*(HoverExitEventArgs args)`|
  |`OnSelectEnter*(XRBaseInteractor interactor)`<br/>-and-<br/>`OnSelectEnter*(XRBaseInteractable interactable)`|`OnSelectEnter*(SelectEnterEventArgs args)`|
  |`OnSelectExit*(XRBaseInteractor interactor)`<br/>-and-<br/>`OnSelectExit*(XRBaseInteractable interactable)`|`OnSelectExit*(SelectExitEventArgs args)` and using `!args.isCanceled`|
  |`OnSelectCancel*(XRBaseInteractor interactor)`|`OnSelectExit*(SelectExitEventArgs args)` and using `args.isCanceled`|
  |`OnActivate(XRBaseInteractor interactor)`|`OnActivated(ActivateEventArgs args)`|
  |`OnDeactivate(XRBaseInteractor interactor)`|`OnDeactivated(DeactivateEventArgs args)`|
  ```csharp
  // Example Interactable that overrides an interaction event method.
  public class ExampleInteractable : XRBaseInteractable
  {
      // Old code -- delete after migrating to new method signature
      protected override void OnSelectEntering(XRBaseInteractor interactor)
      {
          base.OnSelectEntering(interactor);
          // Do something with interactor
      }

      // New code
      protected override void OnSelectEntering(SelectEnterEventArgs args)
      {
          base.OnSelectEntering(args);
          var interactor = args.interactor;
          // Do something with interactor
      }
  }

  // Example behavior that is the target of an Interactable Event set in the Inspector with a Dynamic binding.
  public class ExampleListener : MonoBehaviour
  {
      // Old code -- delete after migrating to new method signature and fixing reference in Inspector
      public void OnSelectEntered(XRBaseInteractor interactor)
      {
          // Do something with interactor
      }

      // New code
      public void OnSelectEntered(SelectEnterEventArgs args)
      {
          var interactor = args.interactor;
          // Do something with interactor
      }
  }
  ```
- Changed which methods are called by the Interaction Manager when either the Interactor or Interactable is unregistered. Previously `XRBaseInteractable` had `OnSelectCanceling` and `OnSelectCanceled` called on select cancel, and `OnSelectExiting` and `OnSelectExited` called when not canceled. This has been combined into `OnSelectExiting(SelectExitEventArgs)` and `OnSelectExited(SelectExitEventArgs)` and the `isCanceled` property is used to distinguish as needed. The **Select Exited** event in the Inspector is invoked in either case.
  ```csharp
  public class ExampleInteractable : XRBaseInteractable
  {
      protected override void OnSelectExiting(SelectExitEventArgs args)
      {
          base.OnSelectExiting(args);
          // Do something common to both.
          if (args.isCanceled)
              // Do something when canceled only.
          else
              // Do something when not canceled.
      }

  }
  ```
- Changed many custom Editors to also apply to child classes so they inherit the custom layout of the Inspector. If your derived class adds a `SerializeField` or public field, you will need to create a custom [Editor](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Editor.html) to be able to see those fields in the Inspector. For Interactor and Interactable classes, you will typically only need to override the `DrawProperties` method in `XRBaseInteractorEditor` or `XRBaseInteractableEditor` rather than the entire `OnInspectorGUI`. See [Extending the XR Interaction Toolkit](../manual/index.html#extending-the-xr-interaction-toolkit) in the manual for a code example.
- Changed `XRInteractionManager.SelectCancel` to call `OnSelectExiting` and `OnSelectExited` on both the `XRBaseInteractable` and `XRBaseInteractor` in a similar interleaved order to other interaction state changes and when either is unregistered.
- Changed order of `XRInteractionManager.UnregisterInteractor` to first cancel the select state before canceling hover state for consistency with the normal update loop which exits select before exiting hover.
- Changed `XRBaseInteractor.StartManualInteraction` and `XRBaseInteractor.EndManualInteraction` to go through `XRInteractionManager` rather than bypassing constraints and events on the Interactable.
- Changed the **GameObject > XR > Grab Interactable** menu item to create a visible cube and use a Box Collider so that it is easier to use.
- Renamed `LocomotionProvider.startLocomotion` to `LocomotionProvider.beginLocomotion` for consistency with method name.

### Fixed
- Fixed Direct Interactor and Socket Interactor causing exceptions when a valid target was unregistered, such as from being destroyed.
- Fixed Ray Interactor clearing custom direction when initializing (fixed initialization of the Original Attach Transform so it copies values from the Attach Transform instead of setting position and rotation values to defaults). ([1291523](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/1291523))
- Fixed Socket Interactor so only an enabled Renderer is drawn while drawing meshes for hovered Interactables.
- Fixed Grab Interactable to respect Interaction Layer Mask for whether it can be hovered by an Interactor instead of always allowing it.
- Fixed Grab Interactable so it restores the Rigidbody's drag and angular drag values on drop.
- Fixed mouse input not working with Unity UI when Active Input Handling was set to Input System Package.
- Fixed issue where Interactables in AR were translated at the height of the highest plane regardless of where the ray is cast.
- Fixed so steps to setup camera in `XRRig` only occurs in Play mode in the Editor.
- Fixed file names of .asmdef files to match assembly name.
- Fixed broken links for the help button (?) in the Inspector so it opens Scripting API documentation for each behavior in the package. ([1291475](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/1291475))
- Fixed XR Rig so it handles the Tracking Origin Mode changing on the device.
- Fixed XR Controller so it only sets position and rotation while the controller device is being tracked instead of resetting to the origin (such as from the device disconnecting or opening a system menu).
